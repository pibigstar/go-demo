# gosexy/to

*Convenient* functions for converting values between common Go datatypes. For
Go 1.1+.

This package ignores errors and allows quick-and-dirty conversions between Go
datatypes.  When any conversion seems unreasonable a [zero value][3] is used as
fallback.

If you're not working with human provided data, fuzzy input or if you'd rather
not ignore any error in your program, you should better use the standard Go
packages for conversion, such as [strconv][4], [fmt][5] or even [standard
conversion][6] they may be better suited for the task.

## Installation

```sh
go get -u menteslibres.net/gosexy/to
```

## Usage

Import the package

```go
import "menteslibres.net/gosexy/to"
```

Use the available `to` functions to convert a `float64` into a `string`:

```go
// "1.23"
s := to.String(1.23)
```

Or a `bool` into `string`:

```go
// "true"
s := to.String(true)
```

What about the other way around? `string` to `float64` and `string` to `bool`.

```go
// 1.23
f := to.Float64("1.23")

// true
b := to.Bool("true")
```

Note that this package only provides `to.Uint64()`, `to.Int64()` and
`to.Float64()` but no `to.Uint8()`, `to.Uint()` or `to.Float32()` functions, if
you'd like to produce a `float32` instead of a `float64` you'd first use
`to.Float64()` and then cast the output using `float32()`.

```go
f32 := float32(to.Float64("12.34"))
```

There is another important function, `to.Convert()` that accepts any value
(`interface{}`) as first argument and also a `reflect.Kind`, as second, that
defines the data type the first argument will be converted to, this is also
the only function that returns an `error` value.

```go
val, err := to.Convert("12345", reflect.Int64)
```

Date formats and durations are also handled, you can use many fuzzy date formats
and they would be converted into `time.Time` values.

```go
timeVal = to.Time("2012-03-24")
timeVal = to.Time("Mar 24, 2012")

durationVal := to.Duration("12s37ms")
```

Now, an important question: how fast is this library compared to standard
methods, like the `fmt` or `strconv` packages?

It is, of course, a little slower that `strconv` methods but it is faster than
`fmt`, so it provides an acceptable speed for most projects. You can test it by
yourself:

```sh
$ go test -test.bench=.
